# Ros2-Simulated-Clean-Robot
In this project, I built a simulated cleaning robot system using the ROS2 platform, supporting real-time mapping. The system integrates slam_toolbox to perform online SLAM, allowing the robot to navigate while being controlled via keyboard input.
                        
I was responsible for constructing the robot's URDF model, setting up the Gazebo simulation environment, and developing and debugging ROS2 nodes. The system supports multi-sensor simulation and offers real-time visualization through RViz.
                        
This project deepened my understanding of ROS2 communication mechanisms and robotic system architecture.
